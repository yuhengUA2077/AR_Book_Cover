# AR Book Cover
This project uses Unity and Vuforia to create an AR book cover. The output program can be run on Android smartphones.

## Instructions
To interact with the code, download and save the "front_cover.jpg" and "back_cover_1.jpg" in the Image/ as the target images. Use the link in the README.md to download AR_book_cover.apk to your Android smartphone and open it. The application will be installed by itself. The application will open your camera to scan the target image. Please note you need to allow camera access first. Once you scan the "front_cover.jpg", you will see the title of the book and the author name in the form of AR texts and an AR model on the front cover. For "back_cover_1.jpg", you will see the brief information of the book. Once you cover your hand or other objects on the back cover, you will see a paragraph of AR text which is a short review of the book.

## Limitations
* The original back cover of the book is unable to be used as an image target for too many repetitive patterns. Therefore a movie poster is used instead as the "back cover" of the book.
* The virtual button feature for the back cover works more unstable on the smartphone camera than the laptop camera.
* The Unity Project is too large to be pushed up to Github. The scene file and the C# script are committed instead as works.
